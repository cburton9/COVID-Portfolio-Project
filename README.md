# COVID-Portfolio-Project

Project Summary
This SQL script explores a COVID-19 dataset to gain insights into various aspects of the pandemic, including:

- Case Fatality Rate: It estimates the likelihood of death from COVID-19 infection for different locations.
- Infection Rates: It identifies countries with the highest percentages of their population infected.
- Death Rates: It highlights countries with the highest death counts relative to population size.
- Global Impact: It calculates global totals for new cases, deaths, and death percentage.
- Vaccination Rates: It tracks the percentage of the population that has received at least one vaccination dose, employing various SQL techniques for calculation and presentation.

The script demonstrates valuable data analysis methods using joins,window functions, aggregations, filtering, and temporary tables/views. This information can be used to understand the global and regional spread of COVID-19, assess its impact, and potentially inform public health strategies.
